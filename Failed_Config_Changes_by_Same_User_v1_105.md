### Type

TTP (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)

### Logging Required

- Sysmon or equivalent endpoint security solution with process creation, file creation, and registry modification event monitoring enabled.

- Windows Security Event Logs

- Process Creation Logs

- Windows Registry Modification Logs


### Recommended Actions

- Identify the specific configuration changes attempted by the user.

- Check for any successful configuration changes by the same user in the recent past.

- Review the user's login activity to see if there are any unusual patterns.

- Check for any other failed actions by the same user in different streams.

- Correlate with threat intelligence to see if the user's IP or actions match any known malicious patterns.

### Considerations

- A user might be testing new configurations and intentionally causing failures to ensure that the system handles errors correctly. This could result in multiple failed configuration changes within a short period.

- Temporary network or system issues could cause legitimate configuration changes to fail repeatedly. These issues might be resolved without any malicious intent, leading to false positive alerts.

- A user might not have the correct permissions to make configuration changes, leading to repeated failed attempts. This could be due to a misconfiguration in the userâ€™s access rights rather than an actual attack.
